        Did the GIt is useful to the programmers and developers? yes/
        no: and why?
        ans: Yes, GIT is not the perfect version control system, but it's simplicity 
        and usefulness makes it a really good option for programmers. Finally, as I
        stated it would be wonderful that not programmers use GIT, but any person.
